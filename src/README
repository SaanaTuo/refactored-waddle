To compile go to the directory particle_trajectory. 

Then compile the modules vectormod, particlemod and functions with gfortran:

gfortran -c vectormod.f90
gfortran -c particlemod.f90
gfortran -c functions.f90

Note that the module vectormod is used in both modules particlemod and functions.

if you want to use the first version of velocity filter which doesn't make a .xyz file, compile 

gfortran -c velocity_filter.f90

if you want the .xyz file, compile either 

gfortran -c velocity_filter_v2.f90

or gfortran -c velocity_filter_v3.f90

Difference between these is that the latter doesn't write the number of atoms or comment line.

Finally 

gfortran.o vectormod.o particlemod.o functions.o velocity_filter.o

or

-"- velocity_filter_v2.o

or

-"- velocity_filter_v3.o

Now its ready to run. Instructions on how to can be found on the directory run/
