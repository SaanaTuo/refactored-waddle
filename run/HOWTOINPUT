On the first line is the number of particles in the file. 

<N>

After that comes the information on all the particles, every piece of information must be on its own line.

<Identifier of particle 1>  (Identifier is of type integer)
<Mass of particle 1>        (Mass is of type real, units are kilograms)
<Charge of particle 1>      (Charge is of type integer, meaning how many times its the elementary charge)
<x component of velocity of particle 1> (real, units m/s)
<y component of velocity of particle 1>  -"-
<z component of velocity of particle 1>  -"-
...
<z component of velocity of particle N>



Note that the name of input file is specified in the main program in the src/ directory.
